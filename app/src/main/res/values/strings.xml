        - Physics is the scientific study of how matter and energy interact.
        <br />
        <br />
        - This interaction can produce the colors of the rainbow in a shower
        <br />
        <br />
        - At a greater distance, the interaction of matter and energy in the Sun produces
        light and heat. In our eyes the light energy is converted into electrical energy,
        which passes to our brain and allows us to see objects in front of us.

        Fun fact 1:
        <br />"Horsepower" is a well-known unit of measurement, but do you know that there is another unit
        of measurement called "donkey power"? It is defined as 250 watts, which is about a third of
        a horsepower.

        <br /><br />Fun fact 2:
        <br />You probably know that there is a small amount of radiation in a banana due to the presence
        of a natural isotope of potassium. There is actually an informal term for the amount which
        is called banana equivalent dose (BED). It was intended to be a general educational example
        to compare a dose of radioactivity to the dose one is exposed to by eating an average-sized
        banana.

        <br /><br />Fun fact 3:
        <br />A British YouTuber Tom Scott defines the term onosecond, in one of his video titled:
        The Worst Typo I Ever Made, as the second after one makes a terrible mistake, where
        everything you can do is to say: Oh no.
