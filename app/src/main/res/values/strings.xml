        - Physics is the scientific study of how matter and energy interact.
        <br />
        <br />
        - This interaction can produce the colors of the rainbow in a shower
        <br />
        <br />
        - At a greater distance, the interaction of matter and energy in the Sun produces
        light and heat. In our eyes the light energy is converted into electrical energy,
        which passes to our brain and allows us to see objects in front of us.

        - A rainbow is a meteorological phenomenon that appears as a multicolored arc that
        forms with sunlight.

        Fun fact 1:
        <br />"Horsepower" is a well-known unit of measurement, but do you know that there is another
        unit of measurement called "donkey power"? It is defined as 250 watts, which is about a third
        of a horsepower.

        <br /><br />Fun fact 2:
        <br />You probably know that there is a small amount of radiation in a banana due to the presence
        of a natural isotope of potassium. There is actually an informal term for the amount which
        is called "banana equivalent dose" (BED). It was intended to be a general educational example
        to compare a dose of radioactivity to the dose one is exposed to by eating an average-sized
        banana. To be slightly technical, one BED is equivalent to 0.1 microsieverts.

        <br /><br />Fun fact 3:
        <br />A British YouTuber Tom Scott defines the term "onosecond", in one of his video titled:
        "The Worst Typo I Ever Made", as the second after one makes a terrible mistake, where
        everything you can do is to say: "Oh no".

        <br/><br/>Fun fact 4:
        <br/>One of the most ridiculous name of a unit of measurement is "pirate-ninja". A
        pirate-ninja is defined as a kilowatt-hour per Martian day or sol. It is equivalent to
        approximately 40.55 watts.

        <br/><br/>Fun fact 5:
        <br/>Inspired by Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse, one "Mickey" is the smallest resolvable unit of
        distance by a given computer mouse pointing device. Mouse motion is reported in horizontal
        and vertical mickeys. Device sensitivity is usually specified in mickeys per inch. Typical
        resolution is 16 mickeys per millimeter. Available resolutions are up to 600 mickeys per
        millimeter.

        <br/><br/>Fun fact 5:
        <br/>A "Fortnight" is defined as 14 days, but do you know that fortnight is part of a system
        called FFF system? The FFF system's full name is furlong-firkin-fortnight system. It is based
        on unusual or impractical measurements. "Furlong" is the unit of length (201.168m), "firkin"
        is the unit of mass (40.8233133kg), and "fortnight" is the unit of time (14 days). Despite
        being old and impractical, Myanmar still uses furlong in conjunction with miles to indicate
        distances on highway signs. Also, the terms was originated in England in the late 13th or early
        14th century, therefore during the 16th century, before the SI units and the imperial units
        (18th century), furlong is used on horse racing in England and they are still using it today.
